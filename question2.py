# Question (2)
# Write a Python program to ask a student to enter their mark scored and it returns
# the grade obtained according to the following:

# Percentage >= 80%: Grade B
# Percentage >= 70%: Grade C
# Percentage >= 60%: Grade D
# Percentage >= 40%: Grade E
# Percentage < 40%:  Grade F
# Get the student's mark

elif mark >= 60:
    grade = 'D'
elif mark >= 40:
    grade = 'E'
